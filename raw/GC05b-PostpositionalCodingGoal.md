Postpositional Coding of Goal

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a goal was investigated. The
positive value of this feature reflects the presence of a marker
following the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional. In Kalkoti,
this semantic role is coded by a postposition, as shown in (1).

|     | 'The woman went to the market.' (XKA-Val-JK:054) |          |         |                                           |     |     |

This is a feature of a majority of the sample languages, either as the
only explicit marking or in addition to other coding, such as
prepositions or suffixes.
