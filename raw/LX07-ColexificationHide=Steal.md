Colexification: Hide=Steal

A polysemy pattern shared by a number of languages in the sample is a
verb that corresponds to the semantic notion of 'hiding' as well as that
of 'stealing'. This is the case with Pashto of India, as seen in ‎(1).
It should be noted that this verbal meaning in Pashto is jointly
expressed with a light verb 'to do, make' and an adjectival element
'hidden'.

This colexification pattern is present in about a third of the sample
languages, of which all are either Indo-Aryan or Iranian, and spoken in
the southern and central parts of the region.
