Prepositional Coding of Location

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a location was investigated.
<span id="_Hlk51060338" class="anchor"></span>The positive value of this
feature reflects the presence of a marker preceding the noun phrase,
whether clitical or adpositional. In Iranian Pashto of Pakistan, this
semantic role is coded by a preposition, as shown in (1). For a location
at, or neat, a surface, as in (1a), the preposition *pə* is sufficient,
while for the location inside something, as in (1b),a combination of the
preposition *pə* and a postposition *kiː* is used.

This is a minority feature and limited to Iranian languages (primarily
in the north). It is present (sometimes in addition to other coding,
such as suffixing or a postposition) in eleven of the sample languages.
