Prepositional Coding of Location

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a location was investigated.
The positive value of this feature reflects the presence of a marker
preceding the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional. In Pashto
of Pakistan, this semantic role is coded by a preposition, as shown in
(1). For a location at, or near, a surface, as in (1a), the preposition
*pə* is sufficient, while for the location inside something, as in (1b),
a combination of the preposition *pə* and a postposition *kiː* is used.

This is a minority feature and, in this data sample, limited to Iranian
languages (primarily in the north). In those languages it is sometimes
present in addition to other coding, such as suffixing or a
postposition.
