Postpositional Coding of Location

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a location was investigated.
The positive value of this feature reflects the presence of a marker
following the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional. In Alishang
Pashai, this semantic role is coded by postpositions, as shown in (1).

This is a feature of a majority of the sample languages, either as the
only explicit marking or in addition to other coding, such as
prepositions or suffixes. Languages that lack this feature are found in
the region's northwest.
