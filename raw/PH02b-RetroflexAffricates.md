Retroflex Affricates

The use of retroflex affricates contrasting with affricates with other
places of articulation as well as with other retroflex sounds was
investigated. All of the sample languages that have retroflex affricates
in their inventory also have dental affricates, while the reverse does
not hold true. The inventory of Hunza Burushaski contains voiceless
retroflex affricates, voiceless retroflex fricatives, voiceless dental
affricates, as well as voiceless palatal (or alveolo-palatal)
affricates, as shown in (1).

While the presence of retroflex affricates is not a majority feature in
the region in general, it is a strongly subareal feature. All of the
languages spoken at the geographical core of the Hindu Kush have
retroflex affricates, whether Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Nuristani or
Burushaski.
