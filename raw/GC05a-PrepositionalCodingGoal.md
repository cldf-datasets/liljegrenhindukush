Prepositional Coding of Goal

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a goal was investigated. The
positive value of this feature reflects the presence of a marker
preceding the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional. In Wakhi of
Pakistan, this semantic role is coded by a preposition, as shown in (1).

(1) Wakhi, Pakistan \[wbl(p)\] (Iranian)

This is minority feature and limited to a few of the Iranian languages
in the north. In those languages it is sometimes occurring in addition
to other coding, such as suffixing or a postposition.
