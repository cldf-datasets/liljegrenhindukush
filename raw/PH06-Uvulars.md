Uvulars

The presence of consonants with a uvular place of articulation was
investigated. The uvulars that are found in the sample are almost
without exception either plosives or fricatives. Only uvular consonants
that are used in basic vocabulary have been taken into account, thus
excluding such sounds occurring in vocabulary that can be considered
relatively recent loans. In some cases it has been difficult to
determine with certainty whether the pronunciation is uvular rather than
velar. A generous interpretation has been applied. A language that has a
uvular voiceless plosive /q/ as well as a voiced /ʁ/ and a voiceless
fricative /χ/ is Iranian Darwazi, as exemplified in (1).

| a.  | /astaʁu/ | ‘bone’ (PRSd-40listML:002) |
|-----|----------|----------------------------|
| b.  | /ʃoːχ/   | ‘horn’ (PRSd-40listML:015) |
| c.  | /ləq/    | ‘full’ (PRSd-40listML:012) |

Uvular consonants are present in a little more than half of the sample
languages. All six phylogenetic groups are represented. A slight
north/south divide can be traced, with what seems like a preference for
uvulars in the north as compared to the south.
