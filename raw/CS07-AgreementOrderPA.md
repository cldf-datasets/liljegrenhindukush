P-A Agreement Order

The occurrence of verb agreement reflecting the order P (the more
patient-like argument) followed by A (the more agent-like argument) was
investigated. The presence of this features presupposes simultaneous
agreement with the A argument and the P argument in at least one
tense-aspect category. Hunza Burushaski is an example of this agreement
pattern, as seen in (1). The verb agrees in person, number and gender,
with the P argument by means of a prefix, and with the A argument by
means of a suffix. Burushaski has a four-gender system, in which the
genders traditionally are labelled as HF (human female), HM (human
male), X (a non-human gender), and Y (another non-human gender).

This feature was evidenced in only a small minority of the languages,
curiously spread out geographically. Apart from the isolate Burushaski,
in the northwest, this is also a feature of some of the Indo-Aryan
Pashai varieties in the southwest as well as in Indo-Aryan Kashmiri in
the southeast.
