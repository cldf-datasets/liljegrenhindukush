Grammatical Gender

Agreement is taken as the defining characteristic of grammatical gender.
This is exemplified in ‎(1); the verb in Sawi takes a masculine
agreement suffix *-**u*** with the masculine noun 'rain' as a subject
and a feminine agreement suffix *-**i*** with the feminine noun 'sun'.

A majority of our sample languages display evidence of two or more
genders lexically associated with nouns. Approximately a fifth of the
sample varieties lacks this property altogether, among them the Turkic
and Sino-Tibetan varieties.
