(C)VC Syllable Structure

The occurrence of a single consonant in the position after a vowel was
investigated. This can, but does not have to, co-occur with the presence
of a single onset consonant. Thus, both VC and CVC structures are
examples of the presence of this feature. In Indo-Aryan Torwali, these
structures occur, as displayed in (1).
