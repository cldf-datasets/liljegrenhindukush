Initial Polar Question Particle

Questions that elicit a response equivalent to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ are formed
with an utterance-initial question particle in some languages. In Gojri
as spoken in Afghanistan this is an option, as seen in (1),while similar
polar questions in Gojri as spoken in Pakistan, as in (2), use
intonation to differentiate them from corresponding statements. The
initial polar question particle in Gojri of Afghanistan is mostly likely
a loan from Iranian Dari that has been incorporated relatively recently
into the language.

Approximately a third of the languages in the sample use initial polar
question markers. These represent Indo-Aryan, Nuristani, Iranian, and
Turkic. All of those are languages spoken in Afghanistan.
