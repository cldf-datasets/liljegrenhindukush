Unique R Case

Morphological case on nouns often expresses the syntactic and semantic
relationships between clausal constituents. In this study, we
investigated to what extent a unique case marker was used for the
recipient (R) of a ditransitive clause, vis-à-vis the subject of an
intransitive clause (S), the subject of a transitive clause (A), and the
direct object of a transitive clause (P). This is the case in Indo-Aryan
Amla Pashai , as seen in ‎(1), in which the cliticized case marker (or
postposition) =ntiː (or =aːntiː) ‘to’ is the unique marker of a
recipient noun phrase, whereas the subject of a transitive clause
receive an oblique case suffix (in the past/perfective), and the subject
of an intransitive clause as well as the object of a transitive clause
are zero marked.

Unique case-marking of the R argument is present in the large majority
of the sample languages. The few languages lacking this property are
primarily found in the region’s south.
