Animacy-based Gender

Differentiation in languages with gender categories (see Grammatical
Gender) may be based on animacy differentiation. Often nouns denoting
animates are distinguished from those denoting inanimates in such
systems. This property can be (but is not always) combined with
sex-based gender. In ‎(1), the target is a copula verb with distinct
forms for inanimate and animate agreement.

Animacy-based differentiation of nouns is present in a smaller number of
the sample languages.
