Oblique Object Word Order

The order in a clause between a lexical object and an oblique phrase was
investigated. The latter is a noun phrase or an adverbial phrase that
functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb. The order object
preceded by an oblique phrase is attested for Gawri, as seen in (1).

| 'The boy broke the window with a stone.' (GWC-Val-MZ:025) |                                    |                                    |        |                                            |     |

This order is present in a majority of the sample, either as the only
option or as an alternative to the reverse order. It is mainly absent in
the northwestern part of the region.
