Oblique Object Word Order

The order in a clause between a lexical object and an oblique phrase was
investigated. The latter is a noun phrase or an adverbial phrase that
functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb. The order object
preceded by an oblique phrase is attested for Indo-Aryan Gawri, as seen
in (1).

the northwestern part of the region.
