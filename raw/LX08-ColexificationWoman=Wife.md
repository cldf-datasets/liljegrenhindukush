Colexification: Woman=Wife

A polysemy pattern shared by a number of languages in the sample is a
noun that corresponds to the semantic notion of ‘woman’ as well as that
of ‘wife’. This is the case in Nuristani Ashkun, as seen in ‎(1); in
Indo-Aryan Dameli, as seen in (2), although there is an additional term
exclusively used for ‘wife’; as well as in Iranian Pashto (Pakistan), as
in (3).
