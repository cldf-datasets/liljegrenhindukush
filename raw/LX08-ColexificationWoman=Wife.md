Colexification: Woman=Wife

A polysemy pattern shared by a number of languages in the sample is a
noun that corresponds to the semantic notion of 'woman' as well as that
of 'wife'. This is the case in Ashkun, as seen in ‎(1); in Dameli, as
seen in (2), although there is an additional term exclusively used for
'wife'; as well as in Pashto (Pakistan), as in (3).

southern parts of the region.
