Kinship: MB=FZ

In some languages the same kinship term is used for referring to an
anchor's mother's brother (MB) as the one used for referring to the
father's sister (FZ), i.e. both parents' different-sex siblings. This
pattern occurs in Nagar Burushaski, as can be seen in ‎(1). This term is
lexically distinct from the terms for the anchor's parents and for their
same-sex siblings.
