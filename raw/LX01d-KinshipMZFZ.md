Kinship: MZ=FZ

In some languages, the same kinship term is used for referring to an
anchor’s mother’s sister (MZ) as for referring to father’s sister (FZ).
This pattern occurs in Indo-Aryan Alasai Pashai, as can be seen in ‎(1).
This term is lexically distinct from the term for ‘mother’.

    \[psh(ai)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a.  | aːjə    | ‘mother’ (PSHai-KinKD:002)          |
|-----|---------|-------------------------------------|
| b.  | maːmbiː | ‘mother’s sister’ (PSHai-KinKD:030) |
| c.  | maːmbiː | ‘father’s sister’ (PSHai-KinKD:024) |

This pattern also exists in Korangali Pashai. Here, however, the
polysemy includes the anchor’s mother, maternal aunts, and paternal
aunts, alike, as can be seen in ‎(2).

The feature occurs in approximately a fourth of the sample. It has a
distinctly subareal distribution, occurring in a geographical belt
stretching from the region’s southwestern corner to the region’s
northeastern corner.
