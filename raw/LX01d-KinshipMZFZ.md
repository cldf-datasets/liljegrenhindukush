Kinship: MZ=FZ

In some languages, the same kinship term is used for referring to an
anchor’s mother’s sister (MZ) as for referring to father’s sister (FZ).
This pattern occurs in Alasai Pashai, as can be seen in ‎(1). This term
is lexically distinct from the term for ‘mother’.

    \[psh(ai)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a.  | aːjə    | ‘mother’ (PSHai-Kin-KD:002)          |
|-----|---------|--------------------------------------|
| b.  | maːmbiː | ‘mother’s sister’ (PSHai-Kin-KD:030) |
| c.  | maːmbiː | ‘father’s sister’ (PSHai-Kin-KD:024) |

This pattern also exists in Korangali Pashai. Here, however, the
polysemy includes the anchor’s mother, maternal aunts, and paternal
aunts, alike, as can be seen in ‎(2).

The feature occurs in approximately a fourth of the sample. It has a
distinctly subareal distribution, occurring in a geographical belt
stretching from the region’s southwestern corner to the region’s
northeastern corner.
