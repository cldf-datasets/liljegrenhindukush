Adjective Noun Word Order

The relative order of a noun and an adjective modifying it was
investigated. The order AdjN, i.e. the adjective preceding the noun, is
exemplified by Gawarbati of Afghanistan in (1).

(1) Gawarbati, Afghanistan \[gwt(a)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| poːl-iː                                  | ʈeːkuriː |     |     |     |
|------------------------------------------|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| small-<span class="smallcaps">fsg</span> | girl     |     |     |     |
| ADJ                                      | NOUN     |     |     |     |
| 'the little girl' (GWTa-Val-AG:057)      |          |     |     |     |

Nearly all of the sample languages apply an adjective---noun word order
(either as the only option, or in addition to the reverse order). It is
only entirely absent in a few of the languages.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 55                            | 93  |
| Absent        | 3                             | 5   |
| Indeterminate | 1                             | 2   |
