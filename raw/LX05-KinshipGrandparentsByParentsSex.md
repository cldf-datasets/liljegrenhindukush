Kinship: Grandparents by Parent’s Sex

In the region, there are two types of grandparent terms: a) those that
make a two-way differentiation based on the sex of the referent, and b)
those that make a four-way differentiation based on the sex of the
referent as well as the sex of the anchor’s parent. The latter is the
positive value of this feature. Such four-way differentiation is
exemplified by Pothwari in (1).

| a.  | daːda | ‘father’s father’ (PHR-Kin-UA:013) |
|-----|-------|------------------------------------|
| b.  | daːdi | ‘father’s mother’ (PHR-Kin-UA:014) |
| c.  | naːna | ‘mother’s father’ (PHR-Kin-UA:015) |
| d.  | naːni | ‘mother’s mother’ (PHR-Kin-UA:016) |

A language making a two-way differentiation (i.e. showing a negative
value for this feature) is e.g. Kohistani Shina, as shown in (2).

| a.  | daːdu | ‘father’s father, mother’s father’ (PLK-Kin-RK:013, 015) |
|-----|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| b.  | dadi  | ‘father’s mother, mother’s mother’ (PLK-Kin-RK:014, 016) |

Differentiating grandparents by one’s parent’s sex is a minority pattern
and is only found in a few of the Indo-Aryan languages spoken in the
south.
