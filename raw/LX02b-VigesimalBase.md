Vigesimal Numeral Base

One aspect of numeral expressions is the multiplicational base that is
used. Some languages use a vigesimal numeral base: the general structure
of numerals in those languages is *m20+n* (the actual order of elements
being disregarded; however, see Numeral Composition 10+n and Numeral
Composition 20+n, for a discussion on sequencing), meaning that some
lower numeral *m* is a multiplier of 20 (or an element that is derived
from it) added to it by some other numeral *n* (in the range 1-19) as a
typical way of forming numerals above twenty. When categorizing a
language as using a vigesimal base, the overall structure of forming
numbers up to 99 has been taken as diagnostic. ‘20’ is thus routinely
used as a recurring element for forming numbers beyond the interval 1-19
(see Decimal Numeral Base). No attempt has been made to distinguish pure
vigesimal from hybrid vigesimal-decimal along the lines of WALS, as
there is in most cases no such clear-cut treatment between numbers below
100 and above 100. Shemal Pashai, as displayed in the table, is an
example of a language using a vigesimal base.

| **Shemal Pashai \[aee(sh)\]** |
|-------------------------------|
|                               |
| ‘10’                          |
| ‘20’                          |
| ‘30’                          |
| ‘40’                          |
| ‘50’                          |
| ‘60’                          |
| ‘70’                          |
| ‘80’                          |
| ‘90’                          |
| ‘100’                         |
| ‘110’                         |

A vigesimal base is present in approximately two thirds of the sample,
essentially constituting the overall dominant system in its central
parts.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | %   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 38                            | 64  |
| Absent        | 20                            | 34  |
| Indeterminate | 1                             | 2   |
