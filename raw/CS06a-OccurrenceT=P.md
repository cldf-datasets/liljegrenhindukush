Occurrence of Theme=Patient (Indirect Object Construction)

The occurrence of an indirect object construction was investigated, that
is: whether the theme of a ditransitive verb is treated like the patient
of a mono-transitive verb, whereas the recipient is given a different
treatment. In Iranian Darwazi, as seen in (1), the patient in the
mono-transitive clause (1a) is coded with the postpositional direct
object clitic *=ra*, which is the same coding that the theme in the
ditransitive clause (1b) receives, whereas the recipient is coded with
the preposition *baj* ‘to’.

This feature was evidenced (as the only possible construction or as a
construction in addition to other constructions) in almost all the
languages in the sample. For the remaining languages, it was not
possible to determine whether the construction is possible based on the
present data set.
