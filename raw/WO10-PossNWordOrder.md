Possessive Noun Word Order

The order of an independent possessive pronoun with respect to the head
noun was investigated. The order PossN, i.e. the possessive pronoun
preceding the noun, is exemplified by Khowar in (1).

(1) Khowar \[khw\] (Indo-Aryan)

| haja                                   | ta       | kitaːb=aː                             |     |     |
|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|-----|-----|
| that                                   | 2sg.poss | book<span class="smallcaps">=q</span> |     |     |
|                                        | POSS     | <span class="smallcaps">NOUN</span>   |     |     |
| 'Is that your book?' (KHW-Dem-AA:004a) |          |                                       |     |     |

Nearly all of the sample languages apply a possessive---noun word order
(some of them in addition to the use of a possessive affix). It is
entirely absent only in one of the languages, namely Iranian Darwazi.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 58                            | 98  |
| Absent        | 1                             | 2   |
| Indeterminate | 0                             | 0   |
