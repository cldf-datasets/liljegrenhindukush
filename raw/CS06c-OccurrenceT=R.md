Occurrence of Theme=Recipient (Double Object Construction)

The occurrence of a double object construction was investigated, that
is: whether both the recipient and the theme of a ditransitive verb are
treated like the patient of a mono-transitive verb. Although it cannot
be entirely excluded, there is no clear example in the present data set
of that construction type, if both NP marking and verbal agreement are
taken into account. See Occurrence of Recipient=Patient and Occurrence
of Theme=Patient for construction types observed in ditransitive
clauses. This feature would deserve a more thorough investigation.
