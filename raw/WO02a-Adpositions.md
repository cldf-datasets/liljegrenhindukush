Adpositions

This feature is defined as the occurrence of a distinct category of
syntactic (vis-à-vis morphological) elements that combine with nouns or
pronouns to express spatial or temporal relations. Admittedly, the
distinction between such a category and that of morphological case
marking is not altogether straightforward. In some of the region's
languages, the adposition determines the grammatical case of its
(nominal or pronominal) complement, as in Pashto of Pakistan. The use of
the postposition *ta* 'to' requires the preceding complement to be coded
in the oblique case, as shown in (1).

(1) Pashto, Pakistan \[pbu(p)\] (Iranian)

In the region, there are no languages that clearly lack this property.
