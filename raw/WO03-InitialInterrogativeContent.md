Initial Interrogative in Content Question

Crosslinguistically, interrogative phrases occur either obligatorily at
the beginning of the sentence (as it does in English), or in other
positions, such as in the position in which the corresponding
non-interrogative phrase occurs. The adjectival interrogative in the
Alingar Pashai content question in (1) occurs immediately before its
noun phrase head, just like corresponding non-interrogative adjectival
modifiers do.

In the sample, none of the languages display an obligatory
sentence-initial occurrence. Instead, interrogative phrases occur in the
same position as in non-interrogative sentences.
