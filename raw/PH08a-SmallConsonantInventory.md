Small Consonant Inventory

The size of the consonant inventory of each language was investigated.
The categories labelled “small” (6-14 consonants) and “moderately small”
(15-18 consonants) in WALS, were collapsed and any inventory size
comprising 18 or less consonants were considered small. <span
id="_Hlk50484060" class="anchor"></span>In order to operationalize the
analysis, only the 40-item list was used as a basis. The resulting value
for an individual language should therefore be regarded as relative in
relation to the sample in general (see Large Consonant Inventory), and
not as an absolute statement about inventory size. Taking more lexical
data into account may very well render a different result. An inventory,
using the above-mentioned method, representative of the value small is
that of Turkic Kyrgyz, as displayed in the table, with its 17
consonants.

<span id="_Hlk50485920" class="anchor"></span>Only two of the sample
languages were recorded as using 18 or less consonants in the 40-item
list, Turkic Kyrgyz and Nuristani East Kati.
