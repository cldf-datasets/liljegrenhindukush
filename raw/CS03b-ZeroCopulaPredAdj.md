Zero Copula for Predicate Adjectives

Clauses with nonverbal predicates may or may not have a copula, i.e. an
element explicitly linking a copula subject with a copula complement.
For complements encoding properties, some of the sample languages do not
need an overt copula, as shown for Ishkashimi in ‎(1) and Uzbek in ‎(2).

(1) Ishkashimi \[isk\] (Iranian)

| aw                                                | χɑːn  | faj  | friː |     |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|------|------|-----|
| that                                              | house | very | good |     |
| 'That house is very beautiful.' (ISK-Dem-SO:006a) |       |      |      |     |

(2) Uzbek \[uzs\] (Turkic)

| uː                                                | uːj   | koːp | jaχsiː |     |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| that                                              | house | very | good   |     |
| 'That house is very beautiful.' (UZS-Dem-WD:006a) |       |      |        |     |

Although not a majority feature in the region in its entirety, this is
possibly a significant sub-areal feature, occurring mainly in the
northern parts of the region, evidently in Iranian, Indo-Aryan and
Turkic.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 11                            | 19  |
| Absent        | 40                            | 68  |
| Indeterminate | 8                             | 13  |
