Kinship: Grandchildren by Sex

Terms referring to one’s grandchildren were investigated. One of the
relevant features is that grandchildren are distinguished according to
their biological sex, i.e. differentiating terms corresponding to
‘grandson’ and ‘granddaughter’, respectively, are used. That is the case
in Indo-Aryan Brokskat, as can be seen in (1).

| a.  | poːʈo | ‘grandson’ (BKK-KinTL:017, 019)      |
|-----|-------|--------------------------------------|
| b.  | pøːʈi | ‘granddaughter’ (BKK-KinTL:018, 020) |

The absence of this value is exemplified by Iranian Wakhi (Pakistan), as
shown in (2). A single term for ‘grandchild’ is used, regardless of sex.

Differentiation by the grandchild’s sex is a majority feature. It is
absent only in a few of the sample languages.

| Present       | 47                            | 80  |
| Absent        | 10                            | 17  |
| Indeterminate | 2                             | 3   |
