Kinship: Grandchildren by Sex

Terms referring to one's grandchildren were investigated. One of the
relevant features is that grandchildren are distinguished according to
their biological sex, i.e. differentiating terms corresponding to
'grandson' and 'granddaughter', respectively, are used. That is the case
in Brokskat, as can be seen in (1).

(1) Brokskat \[bkk\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a\. | poːʈo | 'grandson' (BKK-Kin-TL:017, 019)      |
|-----|-------|---------------------------------------|
| b\. | pøːʈi | 'granddaughter' (BKK-Kin-TL:018, 020) |

The absence of this value is exemplified by Wakhi of Pakistan, as shown
in (2). A single term for 'grandchild' is used, regardless of sex.

(2) Wakhi, Pakistan \[wbl(p)\] (Iranian)

|       |                                    |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| nəpɨs | 'grandchild' (WBLp-Kin-AK:017-020) |

Differentiation by the grandchild's sex is a majority feature. It is
absent only in a few of the sample languages.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 47                            | 80  |
| Absent        | 10                            | 17  |
| Indeterminate | 2                             | 3   |
