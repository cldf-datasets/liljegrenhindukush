Genitive Noun Word Order

The order of a genitive noun phrase with respect to the head noun was
investigated. The order GenN, i.e. the genitive noun phrase preceding
the noun, is exemplified by Gawarbati of Pakistan in (1).

(1) Gawarbati, Pakistan \[gwt(p)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a\. | mumaː-na                                               | puɬ   |     |     |     |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----|-----|-----|
|     | mothers.brother-<span class="smallcaps">gen.msg</span> | son   |     |     |     |
|     | GEN                                                    | NOUN  |     |     |     |
|     | 'uncle's son' (GWTp-Kin-AS:083)                        |       |     |     |     |
| b\. | kitaːb-aːna                                            | faʈaː |     |     |     |
|     | book-<span class="smallcaps">gen.msg</span>            | leaf  |     |     |     |
|     | GEN                                                    | NOUN  |     |     |     |
|     | 'the page of a book' (GWTp-Val-AS:032)                 |       |     |     |     |

Nearly all of the sample languages apply a genitive---noun word order.
It is only entirely absent in a couple of the languages, and
indeterminate for another few.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 51                            | 87  |
| Absent        | 2                             | 3   |
| Indeterminate | 6                             | 10  |
