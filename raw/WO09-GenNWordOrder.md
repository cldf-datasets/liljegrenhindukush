Genitive Noun Word Order

The order of a genitive noun phrase with respect to the head noun was
investigated. The order GenN, i.e. the genitive noun phrase preceding
the noun, is exemplified by Gawarbati of Pakistan in (1).

|     | ‘the page of a book’ (GWTp-Val-AS:032)                                |

Nearly all of the sample languages apply a genitive—noun word order. It
is only entirely absent in a couple of the languages, and indeterminate
for another few.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | %   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 51                            | 87  |
| Absent        | 2                             | 3   |
| Indeterminate | 6                             | 10  |
