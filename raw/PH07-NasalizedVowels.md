Nasalized Vowels

The presence of contrastive vowel nasalization was investigated,
exemplified by Pakistani Gojri words with oral vs nasalized vowels in
(1).

| a.  | /noː/   | ‘nine’ (GJUp-NumRN:009)            |
|-----|---------|------------------------------------|
|     | /nũː/   | ‘daughter-in-law’ (GJUp-KinRN:044) |
| b.  | /naː/   | ‘to, for’ (GJUp-ValQuestRN:035)    |
|     | /nãː/   | ‘name’ (GJUp-40listRN:022)         |
| c.  | /tijiː/ | ‘daughter’ (GJUp-KinRN:005)        |
|     | /dĩː/   | ‘sun’ (GJUp-40listRN:033)          |

Constrastive vowel nasalization occurs in at least a third of the sample
languages, but its occurrence is both geographically and
phylogenetically restricted. It is typical of Indo-Aryan languages in
the south and east. In our sample, it is not evidenced in Turkic,
Iranian or Tibeto-Burman.
