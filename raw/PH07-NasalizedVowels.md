The presence of contrastive vowel nasalization was investigated,
exemplified by Pakistani Gojri words with oral vs corresponding
nasalized vowels in (1).

| a.  | /nuː/   | ‘nine’ (GJUp-NumRN:009)            |
|-----|---------|------------------------------------|
|     | /nũː/   | ‘daughter-in-law’ (GJUp-KinRN:044) |
| b.  | /naː/   | ‘to, for’ (GJUp-ValQuestRN:035)    |
|     | /nãː/   | ‘name’ (GJUp-40listRN:022)         |
| c.  | /tijiː/ | ‘daughter’ (GJUp-KinRN:005)        |
|     | /dĩː/   | ‘sun’ (GJUp-40listRN:033)          |

Constrastive vowel nasalization occurs in 23 of the sample languages,
but its occurrence is both geographically and phylogenetically
restricted. It is typical of Indo-Aryan languages in the south and east.
It does not occur in Turkic, Iranian or Tibeto-Burman.
