CCCV Syllable Structure

The occurrence of three consonants before a vowel was investigated. This
can, but does not have to, co-occur with the presence of one or more
coda consonants. Such sequences of three consonants are exemplified with
words from Balti in (1).

(1) Balti \[bft\] (Sino-Tibetan)

| a\. | /strĩːmoː/ | 'sister' (BFT-Kin-HS:008)   |
|-----|------------|-----------------------------|
| b\. | /rdwaː/    | 'stone' (BFT-40list-HS:032) |

In the region, CCCV Syllable Structures are with relative certainty
found in only a handful of the sample languages, among them the
Sino-Tibetan.
