Possessive Suffixes

The presence of suffixes indexing the inalienable possessor of a
possessee was investigated. This is a feature of Indo-Aryan Alasai
Pashai, as shown in (1). These are mainly used with a restricted class
of possessee nouns such as kinship terms and body parts, and can be used
instead of or in addition to independent possessive pronouns. Some of
these nouns wouldn’t normally occur as a bare stem, i.e. without a
possessive suffix attached to them (indexing for person, and possibly
number). The exact distribution and inventory of such suffixes is still
to be fully investigated.
