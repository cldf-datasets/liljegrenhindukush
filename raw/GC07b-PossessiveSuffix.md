Possessive Suffixes

The presence of suffixes indexing the inalienable possessor of a
possessee was investigated. This is a feature of Alasai Pashai, as shown
in (1). These are mainly used with a restricted class of possessee nouns
such as kinship terms and body parts, and can be used instead of or in
addition to independent possessive pronouns. Some of these nouns
wouldn’t normally occur as a bare stem, i.e. without a possessive suffix
attached to them (indexing for person, and possibly number). The exact
distribution and inventory of such suffixes is still to be fully
investigated.

This is a feature found to a varying extent in approximately a third of
the sample, primarily in the western part of the region. See the feature
Possessive Prefixes for similar functions expressed with prefixes
instead of suffixes.
