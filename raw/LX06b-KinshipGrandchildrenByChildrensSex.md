Kinship: Grandchildren by Children’s Sex

Terms referring to one’s grandchildren were investigated. One of the
relevant features is that grandchildren are distinguished according to
the anchor’s children’s biological sex. This is usually realized as a
four-way differentiation of grandchildren, distinguishing lexically
between a ‘son’s son’, a ‘son’s daughter’, a ‘daughter’s son’ as well as
a ‘daughter’s daughter’. That is the case in Indo-Aryan Kashmiri of
Pakistan, as shown in (1).

| d.  | djuːtɨr | ‘daughter’s daughter’ (KASp-KinKR:020) |

Differentiating grandchildren by one’s children’s sex is a minority
pattern, but it is found in various parts of the region and in several
of the phyla represented in the sample.
