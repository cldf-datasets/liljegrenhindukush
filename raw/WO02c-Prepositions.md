Prepositions

Prepositions are adpositions that precede the noun phrase they occur
with. In Yidgha, see ‎(1), the preposition *ne* encodes a goal relation.

(1) Yidgha \[ydg\] (Iranian)

| ʑiŋgo                                            | **ne** | bazaːr | ʂu-wi                                     |     |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------------------------|-----|
| woman                                            | to     | bazaar | go.<span class="smallcaps">pst-3sg</span> |     |
| 'The woman went to the market.' (YDG-Val-SZ:054) |        |        |                                           |     |

In some of the languages, prepositions co-occur with postpositions to
express certain spatial or temporal relations. This is the case in
Parachi, as can be seen in ‎(2).

(2) Parachi \[prc\] (Iranian)

| bɑːl-ɑːn                                          | **suːr**    | farʃ  | **tar** | naʃtan   |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|---------|----------|
| child-<span class="smallcaps">pl</span>           | on.(top.of) | floor | in      | sit.down |
| 'The children sat on the floor.' (PRC-Val-SH:050) |             |       |         |          |

The presence of prepositions found in our sample is limited to the
Iranian languages of the region and are found primarily in the
northwest.
