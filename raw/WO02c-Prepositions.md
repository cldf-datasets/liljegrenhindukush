Prepositions

Prepositions are adpositions that precede the noun phrase they occur
with. In Iranian Yidgha, see ‎(1), the preposition *ne* encodes a goal
relation.

    \[ydg\] (Iranian)

| ʑiŋgo                                                | **ne ** | bazaːr | ʂu-wi.                                                   |     |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| woman                                                | to      | bazaar | go.<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">pst-3sg</span> |     |
| ‘The woman went to the market.’ (YDG-ValQuestSZ:054) |

In some of the languages, prepositions co-occur with postpositions to
express certain spatial or temporal relations. This is the case in
Iranian Parachi, as can be seen in ‎(2).

| bɑːl-ɑːn                                               | **suːr **   | farʃ  | **tar ** | naʃtan.  |

| ‘The children sat on the floor.’ (PRC-ValQuestSH:050)  |

The presence of prepositions found in our sample is limited to the
Iranian languages of the region and are found primarily in the
northwest.
