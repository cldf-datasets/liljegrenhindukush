Final Polar Question Particle

Questions that elicit a response equivalent to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ are formed
with an utterance-final question particle in some languages.
Tibeto-Burman Ladakhi is one of those languages. An example is given in
(1). The question particle *a* is cliticized to the preceding equative
copula.

Nearly half of the languages in the sample use final polar question
markers. These represent all six phylogenetic groupings included in the
sample.
