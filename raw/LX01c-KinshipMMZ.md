Kinship: M=MZ

Some languages display a certain kind of polysemy pattern in which the
kinship term used for referring to an anchor’s mother (M) is also used
for referring to a mother’s sister (MZ). Usually, that is done by adding
a modifying ‘big’ for a maternal aunt that is older than the anchor’s
mother, and ‘little’ for a maternal aunt that is younger. This pattern
occurs in Nuristani Waigali, as can be seen in ‎(1).

| a.  | jej         | ‘mother’ (WBK-KinSR:002)                                         |
|-----|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| b.  | dyʃtyː jej  | ‘mother’s older sister’ \[lit. big mother\] (WBK-KinSR:031)      |
| c.  | kynʃtyː jej | ‘mother’s younger sister’ \[lit. little mother\] (WBK-KinSR:032) |

The feature occurs in a minority of the sample languages but it has a
distinctly subareal distribution. It occurs, on the one hand in Eastern
Nuristan, and on the other, in Eastern Karakoram. This polysemy is in
some of those languages in addition to a general term for a maternal
aunt, lexically distinct from the term for ‘mother’. In other cases, the
polysemy also extends to the anchor’s father’s sister.
