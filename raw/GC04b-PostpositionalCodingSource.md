Postpositional Coding of Source

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a source or an origin was
investigated. The positive value of this feature reflects the presence
of a marker following the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional.
In Torwali, this semantic role is coded by a postposition, as shown in
(1).

|     | 'The girl tore the page from the book.' (TRW-Val-UD:032) |        |         |                                        |                                         |     |

|     | 'The apple fell from the tree.' (TRW-Val-UD:084) |         |                                         |      |                                           |     |

This is a feature of nearly all the sample languages, either as the only
explicit marking or in addition to other coding, such as prepositions or
suffixes.
