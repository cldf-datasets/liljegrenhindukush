Noun Adjective Word Order

The relative order of a noun and an adjective modifying it was
investigated. The order NAdj, i.e. the adjective following the noun, is
exemplified by Ladakhi in (1).

(1) Ladakhi \[lbj\] (Sino-Tibetan)

| pomo                               | tɕun                               |     |     |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----|-----|
| girl                               | small                              |     |     |
| NOUN                               | <span class="smallcaps">ADJ</span> |     |     |
| 'the little girl' (LBJ-Val-IS:057) |                                    |     |     |

This is a minority feature. Only a few sample languages apply a
noun---adjective word order (either as the only option, or in addition
to the reverse order).

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | \%  |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 7                             | 12  |
| Absent        | 49                            | 83  |
| Indeterminate | 3                             | 5   |
