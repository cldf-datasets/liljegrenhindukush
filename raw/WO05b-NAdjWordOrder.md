Noun Adjective Word Order

The relative order of a noun and an adjective modifying it was
investigated. The order NAdj, i.e. the adjective following the noun, is
exemplified by Tibeto-Burman Ladakhi in (1).

This is a minority feature. Only seven sample languages apply a
noun—adjective word order (either as the only option, or in addition to
the reverse order).

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | %   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 7                             | 12  |
| Absent        | 49                            | 83  |
| Indeterminate | 3                             | 5   |
