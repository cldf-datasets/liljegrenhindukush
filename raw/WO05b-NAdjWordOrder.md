Noun Adjective Word Order

The relative order of a noun and an adjective modifying it was
investigated. The order NAdj, i.e. the adjective following the noun, is
exemplified by Ladakhi in (1).

(1) <span id="_Ref531867975" class="anchor"></span>Ladakhi
    \[lbj\] (Sino-Tibetan)

| pomo                               | tɕun                                              |     |     |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|
| girl                               | small                                             |     |     |
| NOUN                               | <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ADJ</span> |     |     |
| ‘the little girl’ (LBJ-Val-IS:057) |

This is a minority feature. Only a few sample languages apply a
noun—adjective word order (either as the only option, or in addition to
the reverse order).

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | %   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 7                             | 12  |
| Absent        | 49                            | 83  |
| Indeterminate | 3                             | 5   |
