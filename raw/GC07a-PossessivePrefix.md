Possessive Prefixes

The presence of prefixes indexing the inalienable possessor of a
possessee was investigated. This is a feature of Hunza Burushaski, as
shown in (1). These are used with a restricted class of possessee nouns
such as kinship terms and body parts, and are not equal to independent
possessive pronouns, the latter which can be used in possessive
constructions with virtually any noun as a possessee. Some of these
nouns wouldn’t normally occur as a bare stem, i.e. without a possessive
prefix attached to them (indexing for person, animacy and number).

This is a feature found only in the two Burushaski varieties in this
sample. However, see the feature Possessive Suffixes for similar
functions expressed with suffixes instead of prefixes.
