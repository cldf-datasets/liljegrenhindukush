Retroflexion

The use of retroflex sounds to obtain (minimal) contrasts in the lexicon
was investigated. Although a distinct retroflex place of articulation
was detected in most cases, it was indeed the contrast between
alveolar-dental sounds and retroflex (or retracted) sounds with the same
manner of articulation that was taken as diagnostic rather than the
presence of a very specific tongue shape. For some of the languages, and
for some of the subsets, the contrast is probably better described as
apical (or subapical) vs laminal pronunciation.

The inventory of Indo-Aryan Khowar has eight retroflex (or apical
post-alveolar) consonants (plosive, affricate and fricative),
contrasting on the one had with dental/alveolar and on the other with
laminal post-alveolar consonants. Some examples of words in Khowar
containing retroflex sounds are displayed in ‎(1).

Retroflexion is a strongly areal feature, present in as many as 54 of
the sample languages. Turkic is the only phylogenetic grouping in which
this feature is entirely absent.
