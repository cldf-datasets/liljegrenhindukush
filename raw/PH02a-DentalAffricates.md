Dental Affricates

The use of dental affricates contrasting with affricates with other
places of articulation as well as with other dental sounds was
investigated. The inventory of Iranian Wakhi of Pakistan contains a
voiced dental affricate, as well as a palatal (or alveolo-palatal)
affricate, a voiced dental fricative and a voiced interdental fricative,
as shown in (1).

\(1) Wakhi, Pakistan \[wbl(p)\] (Iranian)

| a.  | /dzaq/   | ‘small’ (WBLp-KinEK:010)     |
|-----|----------|------------------------------|
| b.  | /dɕɨmat/ | ‘wife’ (WBLp-KinSA:038)      |
| c.  | /zik/    | ‘tongue’ (WBLp-40listEK:034) |
| d.  | /ðas/    | ‘ten’ (WBLp-NumEK:010)       |

The presence of dental affricates is a strongly areal features, absent
only in about a fifth of the sample languages. The feature is present in
languages across five of the phylogenetic groupings, while absent in
both of the Turkic sample languages.
