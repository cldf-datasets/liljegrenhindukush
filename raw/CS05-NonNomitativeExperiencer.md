Non-Nominative Experiencer

The use of a case form or construction other than the basic/direct or
nominative as a subject to encode a noun phrase as an experiencer was
investigated. In Kashmiri of India, as seen in (1), the experiencer of
the sensation of coldness is expressed as a recipient, with the first
person pronoun form used for dative and ergative alike.

(1) Kashmiri, India \[kas(i)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| 'I feel cold.' (KASi-Val-AN:060)       |                                               |            |     |     |     |

In Aret Pashai, as in (2), the experiencer is expressed as the possessor
of the stimulus, i.e. the 'cold' or the 'coldness', the NP itself
appearing as the object of the transitive verb 'to do', the latter
lacking an explicit subject.

(2) Aret Pashai \[aee(at)\] (Indo-Aryan)

This feature was evidenced in approximately half of the sample. However,
this is not to say that it could not be expressed non-nominatively in
the languages given a negative value.
