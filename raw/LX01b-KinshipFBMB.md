Kinship: FB=MB

In some languages the same kinship term is used for referring to an
anchor’s father’s brother (FB) as the one used for referring to the
mother’s brother (MB). This pattern occurs in Iranian Munji, as can be
seen in ‎(1). This term is also lexically distinct from the term for
‘father’.

    \[mnj\] (Iranian)

| a.  | tɑːt | ‘father’ (MNJ-KinDM:001)            |
|-----|------|-------------------------------------|
| b.  | bɑːj | ‘father’s brother’ (MNJ- KinDM:021) |
| c.  | bɑːj | ‘mother’s brother’ (MNJ- KinDM:027) |

The feature is a minority pattern in the region, but it occurs in a few
geographically clustered languages in the central part of the Hindu
Kush. The languages in question are not all closely related to one
another.
