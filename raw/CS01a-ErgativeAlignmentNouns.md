Ergative Alignment (Nouns)

In an ergative system of case marking, A, the more agent-like NP
argument of a two-place transitive predicate, is encoded differently
from S, the core argument of a one-place intransitive predicate. Any
occurrence (whether consistently or in a sub-domain of a language) of
such (A≠S contrastive) marking of full noun phrases has been taken as
positive evidence of this feature. In Western Kati, the A argument
carries an oblique case suffix *--a* in the past tense, while the S
argument remains zero marked for case.

A majority of our sample languages display evidence of ergative
alignment for nouns. The distribution is clearly subareal, with ergative
alignment in the south and in the central parts of the Hindu Kush
region, and the lack thereof primarily in the north.
