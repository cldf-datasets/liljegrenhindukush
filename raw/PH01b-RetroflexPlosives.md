Retroflex Plosives

The use of retroflex (or apical post-alveolar) plosive consonants
contrasting with dental/alveolar plosives was investigated. In Nuristani
Ashkun, a dental voiceless plosive (1a) contrasts with a retroflex
voiceless plosive (1b), and a dental voiced plosive (1c) contrasts with
a retroflex voiced plosive (1d).

The presence of retroflex plosives is a strongly areal feature, present
in as many as 50 of the sample languages. They are absent in the
inventories of the Turkic languages, some of the Iranian languages and
in Tibeto-Burman Ladakhi.
