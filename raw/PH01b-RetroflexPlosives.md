Retroflex Plosives

The use of retroflex (or apical post-alveolar) plosive consonants
contrasting with dental/alveolar plosives was investigated. In Ashkun, a
dental voiceless plosive (1a) contrasts with a retroflex voiceless
plosive (1b), and a dental voiced plosive (1c) contrasts with a
retroflex voiced plosive (1d).

| a.  | /zat /   | ‘night’ (ASK-40list-WS:024)    |

| c.  | /awndej/ | ‘grandfather’ (ASK-Kin-WS:013) |
| d.  | /muɖuk / | ‘frog’ (ASK-Val-WS:034)        |

The presence of retroflex plosives is a strongly areal feature, absent
only in the inventories of the Turkic languages, some of the Iranian
languages and possibly in one of the Sino-Tibetan languages.
