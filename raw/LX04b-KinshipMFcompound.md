Kinship: M-F Compound

Terms referring to one’s parents were investigated. In some languages,
this is expressed through a compound involving the lexemes ‘mother’ and
‘father’ (see Kinship: Parent Compound). These compounds are
sequentially structured, either as ‘mother’ followed by ‘father’ (the
positive value here) or as ‘father’ followed by ‘mother’ (the negative
value). Indo-Aryan Aret Pashai is an example of the former, as can be
seen in ‎(1), and Nuristani Prasun is an example of the latter, as can
be seen in (2).

The feature value M+F is a majority pattern in the region. However,
while the M+F pattern is restricted to the three Indo-Iranian phyla, the
F+M pattern occurs in languages belonging to all six phylogenetic
groupings. There is a clearly geographical distribution, with the M+F
pattern in the south and west, and the F+M pattern in the north and
east.
