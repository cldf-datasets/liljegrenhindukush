Lateral Fricatives

The occurrence of voiceless lateral fricatives was investigated. In
languages where it occurs, it appears to contrast phonologically with
voiceless lateral approxmants. Indo-Aryan Gawarbati is one of those
languages. See examples in (1).

Lateral fricatives is a minority feature in the area, but with its
presence in 13 of the sample languages it has an overall frequency that
is considerably higher than its global presence. It is found in
Tibeto-Burman as well as among the region’s Iranian and Indo-Aryan
languages.
