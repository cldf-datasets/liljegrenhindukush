Lateral Fricatives

The occurrence of voiceless lateral fricatives was investigated. In
languages where it occurs, it appears to contrast phonologically with
voiceless lateral approxmants. Gawarbati of Pakistan is one of those
languages. See examples in (1).

(1) Gawarbati, Pakistan \[gwt(p)\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a\. | /ɬe/  | 'three' (GWTp-Num-AS:003)   |
|-----|-------|-----------------------------|
| b\. | /puɬ/ | 'son' (GWTp-Kin-AS:004)     |
| c\. | /ɡaɬ/ | 'skin' (GWTp-40list-AS:030) |

The presence of lateral fricatives is a minority feature in the area,
but its presence is still considerably higher than its corresponding
global frequency. It is found in Sino-Tibetan as well as among the
region's Iranian and Indo-Aryan languages.
