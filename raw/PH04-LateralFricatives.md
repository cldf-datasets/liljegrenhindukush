Lateral Fricatives

The occurrence of voiceless lateral fricatives was investigated. In
languages where it occurs, it appears to contrast phonologically with
voiceless lateral approxmants. Indo-Aryan Gawarbati is one of those
languages. See examples in (1).

| a.  | /ɬe/  | ‘three’ (GWTp-NumAS:003)   |

| b.  | /puɬ/ | ‘son’ (GWTp-KinAS:004)     |
| c.  | /ɡaɬ/ | ‘skin’ (GWTp-40listAS:030) |

The presence of lateral fricatives is a minority feature in the area,
but its presence is still considerably higher than its corresponding
global frequency. It is found in Tibeto-Burman as well as among the
region’s Iranian and Indo-Aryan languages.
