Decimal Numeral Base

One aspect of numeral expressions is the multiplicational base that is
used. Some languages use a decimal numeral base: the general structure
of numerals in those languages is *m10+n* (the actual order of elements
being disregarded; however, see Numeral Composition 10+n and Numeral
Composition 20+n, for a discussion on sequencing), meaning that some
lower numeral *m* is a multiplier of 10 (or an element that is derived
from it) added to it by some other lower numeral *n* as a typical way of
forming numerals above ten. When categorizing a language as using a
decimal base, the overall structure of forming numbers up to 99 has been
taken as diagnostic. The existence of a lexeme ‘20’ without any obvious
derivational relationship to any other numeral or numeral base has not
been regarded as counterevidence as long as ‘20’ is not routinely used
as a recurring element for forming numbers beyond the interval 20-29
(see Vigesimal Numeral Base). Sanjan Pashai, as displayed in the table,
is an example of a language using a decimal base. However, the numerals
‘40’, ‘50’, etc., are obvious Persian loan forms, setting the language
off from some of its closest relatives that apply a vigesimal system.

| ‘10’                                    |
| ‘20’                                    |
| ‘30’                                    |
| ‘40’                                    |
| ‘50’                                    |
| ‘60’                                    |
| ‘70’                                    |
| ‘80’                                    |
| ‘90’                                    |
| ‘100’                                   |
| ‘110’                                   |

A decimal base is present in approximately a third of the sample,
essentially in its peripheral western and southern parts.

| Feature value | \# of varieties displaying it | %   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Present       | 19                            | 32  |
| Absent        | 39                            | 66  |
| Indeterminate | 1                             | 2   |
