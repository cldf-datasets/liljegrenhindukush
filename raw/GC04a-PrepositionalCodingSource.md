Prepositional Coding of Source

The strategy for marking a noun phrase as a source or an origin was
investigated. The positive value of this feature reflects the presence
of a marker preceding the noun phrase, whether clitical or adpositional.
In Sanglechi this semantic role is coded by a preposition, as shown in
(1).

postposition) in approximately a fifth of the languages.
