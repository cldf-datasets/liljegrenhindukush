Kinship: F=FB

Some languages display a certain kind of polysemy pattern in which the
kinship term used for referring to an anchor’s father (F) is also used
for referring to a father’s brother (FB). Usually, that is done by
adding a modifying ‘big’ for a paternal uncle that is older than the
anchor’s father, and ‘little’ for a paternal uncle that is younger. This
pattern occurs in Tibeto-Burman Balti, as can be seen in ‎(1).

    \[bft\] (Tibeto-Burman)

| a.  | ata           | ‘father’ (BFT-KinHS:001)                                           |
|-----|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| b.  | ata tɕʰoʁo    | ‘father’s older brother’ \[lit. big father\] (BFT- KinHS:022)      |
| c.  | ata tsʰuntseː | ‘father’s younger brother’ \[lit. little father\] (BFT- KinHS:023) |

The feature occurs in approximately a third of the sample, essentially
in a central belt stretching through the geographical core of the region
from west to east. This polysemy is sometimes in addition to a general
term for a paternal uncle, lexically distinct from the term for
‘father’.
