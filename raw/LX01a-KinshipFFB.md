Kinship: F=FB

Some languages display a certain kind of polysemy pattern in which the
kinship term used for referring to an anchor's father (F) is also used
for referring to a father's brother (FB). Usually, that is done by
adding a modifying 'big' for a paternal uncle that is older than the
anchor's father, and 'little' for a paternal uncle that is younger. This
pattern occurs in Balti, as can be seen in ‎(1).

(1) Balti \[bft\] (Sino-Tibetan)

| a\. | ata           | 'father' (BFT-Kin-HS:001)                                           |
|-----|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| b\. | ata tɕʰoʁo    | 'father's older brother' \[lit. big father\] (BFT- Kin-HS:022)      |
| c\. | ata tsʰuntseː | 'father's younger brother' \[lit. little father\] (BFT- Kin-HS:023) |

The feature occurs in approximately a third of the sample, essentially
in a central belt stretching through the geographical core of the region
from west to east. This polysemy is sometimes in addition to a general
term for a paternal uncle, lexically distinct from the term for
'father'.
