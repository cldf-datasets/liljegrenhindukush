Kinship: Parent Compound

Terms referring to one's parents were investigated. In some languages,
this is expressed though a compound involving the lexemes 'mother' and
'father', either instead of or in addition to a distinct 'parent(s)'
lexeme. The relative order of those elements is described by another
feature (Kinship: M-F Compound). Kundal Shahi uses this type of
compound, as can be seen in ‎(1). Typically the two roots are
juxtaposed, as in Kundal Shahi, but explicitly conjoining elements
occur, too.

| a\. | meːl maːl | 'parents' (SHD-Kin-GQ:003) |
|-----|-----------|----------------------------|
| b\. | meːl      | 'mother' (SHD- Kin-GQ:002) |
| c\. | maːl      | 'father' (SHD- Kin-GQ:001) |

The feature is a majority pattern in the region, occurring across the
region, in languages of all phylogenetic groups.
