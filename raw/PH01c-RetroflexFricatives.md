Retroflex Fricatives

The use of retroflex (or apical post-alveolar) fricative consonants
contrasting with dental/alveolar fricatives, on the one hand, and with
laminal post-alveolar/palatal fricatives, on the other, was
investigated. In many of the languages that have retroflex fricatives,
they tend to form a subset together with retroflex affricates with whom
they often stand in an allophonic relationship. In Bateri, dental
fricatives contrast with retroflex fricatives and with laminal
post-alveolar fricatives, as shown in (1).

(1) Bateri \[btv\] (Indo-Aryan)

| a\. | /syr/  | 'sun' (BTV-40list-MB:033)        |
|-----|--------|----------------------------------|
| b\. | /ɕoːr/ | 'father-in-law' (BTV-Kin-MB:050) |
| c\. | /ʂu/   | 'six' (BTV-Num-MB:006)           |

The presence of retroflex fricatives is a majority feature in the area,
found in a little over half of the sample languages. The presence of
this feature is particularly prominent at the geographical core of the
Hindu Kush, shared by Indo-Aryan, Nuristani, Iranian and Burushaski
alike.
