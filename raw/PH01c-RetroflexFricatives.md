Retroflex Fricatives

The use of retroflex (or apical post-alveolar) fricative consonants
contrasting with dental/alveolar fricatives, on the one hand, and with
laminal post-alveolar/palatal fricatives, on the other, was
investigated. In many of the languages that have retroflex fricatives,
they tend to form a subset together with retroflex affricates with whom
they often stand in an allophonic relationship. In Indo-Aryan Bateri,
dental fricatives contrast with retroflex fricatives and with laminal
post-alveolar fricatives, as shown in (1).

Retroflex fricatives is a majority feature in the area, present in 33 of
the sample languages. The presence of this feature is particularly
prominent at the geographical core of the Hindu Kush, shared by
Indo-Aryan, Nuristani, Iranian and Burushaski alike.
