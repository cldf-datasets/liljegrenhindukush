Unique S Case

Morphological case on nouns often expresses the syntactic and semantic
relationships between clausal constituents. In this study, we
investigated to what extent a unique case marker was used in the past
(or perfective) for the subject argument of an intransitive clause (S),
vis-à-vis the subject of a transitive clause (A), the direct object of a
transitive clause (P), and a recipient (R). This is the case in Hindko,
as seen in ‎(1), in which the subject of an intransitive clause is zero
marked, whereas the subject of a transitive subject is marked with an
ergative case clitic *=suɳ* and the (definite) object is marked with a
dative case clitic *=koː*.

Unique case-marking of the S argument is present in less than a quarter
of the sample languages. In the other languages its case marking is the
same as that for one or more of the other arguments, A, P or R.
