Unique S Case

Morphological case on nouns often expresses the syntactic and semantic
relationships between clausal constituents. In this study, we
investigated to what extent a unique case marker was used in the past
(or perfective) for the subject argument of an intransitive clause (S),
vis-à-vis the subject of a transitive clause (A), the direct object of a
transitive clause (P), and a recipient (R). This is the case in
Indo-Aryan Hindko, as seen in ‎(1), in which the subject of an
intransitive clause is zero marked, whereas the subject of a transitive
subject is marked with an ergative case clitic *=suɳ* and the (definite)
object is marked with a dative case clitic *=koː*.

Unique case-marking of the S argument is present in only 13 of the
sample languages. In the other languages its case marking is the same as
that for one or more of the other arguments, A, P or R.
