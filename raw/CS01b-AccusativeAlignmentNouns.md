Accusative Alignment (Nouns)

In an accusative system of case marking, P, the more patient-like NP
argument of a two-place transitive predicate, is encoded differently
from S, the core argument of a one-place intransitive predicate. Any
occurrence (whether consistently or in a sub-domain of a language) of
such (P≠S contrastive) marking of full noun phrases has been taken as
positive evidence of this feature. In Uzbek (see ‎(1)), the P argument
carries a case suffix *--deː*, while the S argument remains zero marked
for case. (The case marking *‑de* in addition encodes various locative
relations. A direct object with definite reference may also occur with a
suffix *--niː*.)

Accusative alignment is clearly subareal in its distribution. While it
is not a feature associated with the geographical core of the Hindu
Kush, it is strongly represented in the northwestern sub-region (in
Indo-Aryan, Nuristani, Iranian and Turkic), and then again in the
southeastern sub-region (Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman).
