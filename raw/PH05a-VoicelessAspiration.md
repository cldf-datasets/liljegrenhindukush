Voiceless Aspiration

The use of aspiration to contrast voiceless sounds was investigated. In
languages that display this feature there is a subset of aspirated
sounds that contrasts at several places of articulation with the
corresponding unaspirated sounds. The inventory (see table below) of
Indo-Aryan Shina of Gilgit exemplifies such a system in which voiceless
plosives and affricates display aspiration contrasts. Some examples of
aspirated plosives and affricates are given in (1).

Voiceless aspiration contrast is present in approximately half of the
regional sample. It is a partly sub-areal feature, primarily associated
with the Eastern part of the region; partly a phylogenetic feature,
present primarily (but not uniformly so) in Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman
and Burushaski, largely absent in Iranian, and completely absent in
Nuristani and Turkic.
