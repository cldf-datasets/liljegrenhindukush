GC01a,GC01a,"Grammatical Gender

Agreement is taken as the defining characteristic of grammatical gender.
This is exemplified in ‎(1); the verb in Sawi takes a masculine
agreement suffix *-**uː*** with the masculine noun ‘rain’ as a subject
and a feminine agreement suffix *-**iː*** with the feminine noun ‘sun’.

GC01b,GC01b,"Sex-based Gender

Differentiation in languages with gender categories (see Grammatical
Gender) may be based on or linked to a biological differentiation
between male and female referents, as in ‎(1). In languages with a
masculine-feminine differentiation, nouns denoting inanimates or
non-humans can be assigned masculine or feminine gender too.

PH01a,PH01a,"Retroflexion

The use of retroflex sounds to obtain (minimal) contrasts in the lexicon
was investigated. Although a distinct retroflex place of articulation
was detected in most cases, it was indeed the contrast between
alveolar-dental sounds and retroflex (or retracted) sounds with the same
manner of articulation that was taken as diagnostic rather than the
presence of a very specific tongue shape. For some of the languages, and
for some of the subsets, the contrast is probably better described as
apical (or subapical) vs laminal pronunciation.

The inventory of Indo-Aryan Khowar has eight retroflex (or apical
post-alveolar) consonants (plosive, affricate and fricative),
contrasting on the one had with dental/alveolar and on the other with
laminal post-alveolar consonants. Some examples of words in Khowar
containing retroflex sounds are displayed in ‎(1).

kinship term used for referring to an anchor’s father (F) is also used
for referring to a father’s brother (FB). Usually, that is done by

The feature occurs in approximately a third of the sample, essentially
in a central belt stretching through the geographical core of the region
from west to east. This polysemy is sometimes in addition to a general
term for a paternal uncle, lexically distinct from the term for
‘father’.

In some languages the same kinship term is used for referring to an
anchor’s father’s brother (FB) as the one used for referring to the
mother’s brother (MB). This pattern occurs in Iranian Munji, as can be
seen in ‎(1). This term is also lexically distinct from the term for
‘father’.

geographically clustered (but not all of them closely related) languages
in the central part of the Hindu Kush.
