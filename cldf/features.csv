GC01a,Grammatical Gender,"Agreement is taken as the defining characteristic of grammatical gender.
This is exemplified in ‎(1); the verb in Sawi takes a masculine
agreement suffix *-**u*** with the masculine noun ‘rain’ as a subject
and a feminine agreement suffix *-**i*** with the feminine noun ‘sun’.

A majority of our sample languages display evidence of two or more
genders lexically associated with nouns. Approximately a fifth of the
sample varieties lacks this property altogether, among them the Turkic
and Sino-Tibetan varieties.",Grammatical categories
GC01b,Sex-based Gender,"Differentiation in languages with gender categories (see Grammatical
Gender) may be based on or linked to a biological differentiation
between male and female referents, as in Ushojo ‎(1). In languages with
a masculine-feminine differentiation, nouns denoting inanimates or
non-humans can be assigned masculine or feminine gender too.

Only a little less than half of the sample display multi-value distance
contrasts. There are no obvious geographical correlations.

This feature deserves a more thorough investigation, as there are in
many of the sample languages additional deictic parameters involved
(such as emphasis, elevation and other geomorphic properties), as well
as non-deictic distinctions expressed (such as case, number and gender)
that make the analysis of the limited material extremely challenging.
The present study should therefore be treated as preliminary in this

PH01a,Retroflexion,"The use of retroflex sounds to obtain (minimal) contrasts in the lexicon
was investigated. Although a distinct retroflex place of articulation
was detected in most cases, it was indeed the contrast between
alveolar-dental sounds and retroflex (or retracted) sounds with the same
manner of articulation that was taken as diagnostic rather than the
presence of a very specific tongue shape. For some of the languages, and
for some of the subsets, the contrast is probably better described as
apical (or subapical) vs laminal pronunciation.

The inventory of Khowar has eight retroflex (or apical post-alveolar)
consonants (plosive, affricate and fricative), contrasting on the one
had with dental/alveolar and on the other with laminal post-alveolar
consonants. Some examples of words in Khowar containing retroflex sounds

It should be pointed out that the treatment of aspirated series is an
issue which is far from straightforward. In some cases, the distribution
and manifestation of aspiration co-occurring with voicing has led
linguists analyzing individual languages (including Indus Kohistani) to
apply a suprasegmental or a cluster analysis rather than positing an
entire subset of aspirated voiced units.

Voiced aspiration contrast is a minority feature in the region, possibly
present in only a few of the varieties. All of those, except Iranian
Parachi, are Indo-Aryan languages spoken in the southern and central
parts of the region.",Phonology
PH06,Uvulars,"The presence of consonants with a uvular place of articulation was
investigated. The uvulars that are found in the sample are almost
without exception either plosives or fricatives. Only uvular consonants
that are used in basic vocabulary have been taken into account, thus
excluding such sounds occurring in vocabulary that can be considered
relatively recent loans. In some cases, it has been difficult to
determine with certainty whether the pronunciation is uvular rather than
velar. A generous interpretation has been applied. A language that has a
uvular voiceless plosive /q/ as well as a voiced /ʁ/ and a voiceless
fricative /χ/ is Darwazi, as exemplified in (1).

syntactic (vis-à-vis morphological) elements that combine with nouns or

distinction between such a category and that of morphological case
marking is not altogether straightforward. In some of the region’s
languages, the adposition determines the grammatical case of its
(nominal or pronominal) complement, as in Pashto of Pakistan. The use of
the postposition *ta* ‘to’ requires the preceding complement to be coded
in the oblique case, as shown in (1).

sample languages lack agreement marking on verbs altogether.",Clause structure
CS05,Non-Nominative Experiencer,"The use of a case form or construction other than the basic/direct or
nominative as a subject to encode a noun phrase as an experiencer was
investigated. In Kashmiri of India, as seen in (1), the experiencer of

pattern, as seen in (1). The verb agrees in person, number and gender,
with the P argument by means of a prefix, and with the A argument by
means of a suffix. Burushaski has a four-gender system, in which the
genders traditionally are labelled as HF (human female), HM (human
male), X (a non-human gender), and Y (another non-human gender).

LX03a,Numeral Composition 10+n,"One aspect of numeral expressions is the sequential order of elements in
complex cardinal numerals, i.e. numerals that combine one or more
multiplicational bases with a single lower numeral to express numbers

11-19 were treated as a feature separate from the composition of the
numerals 21-29. The present feature deals with the composition of the
former series (see Numeral Composition 20+n for the latter). This aspect
is not to be confused with the use of decimal versus vigesimal bases
(see Decimal Numeral Base; Vigesimal Numeral Base). The positive value
is defined as following the order 10+n, and the negative as following
the reverse order, n+10, alternatively applying an altogether different
organizing principle. 10 is here not to be regarded as necessarily
homophonous or even synchronically fully recognizable from the
expression of the numeral ‘10’. Instead, the formula stands for an
underlying syntactic or morphological structure in which the form of the
corresponding lower numeral *n*, and its relative sequential order as
preposed or postposed in the complex expression, has been taken as
diagnostic. Wakhi of Afghanistan exemplifies the order 10+n in the

The numeral composition order 10+n is present in a minority of the
sample, in approximately a fourth of the languages, and primarily in the
north, encompassing all Sino-Tibetan, Turkic and Burushaski varieties,
but only a few of the Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages.",Lexicon
LX03b,Numeral Composition 20+n,"One aspect of numeral expressions is the sequential order of elements in
complex cardinal numerals, i.e. numerals that combine one or more
multiplicational bases with a lower numeral to express numbers above 10.
Due to differential behaviour, the composition of the numerals 11-19
were treated as a feature separate from the composition of the numerals
21-29. The present feature deals with the composition of the latter
series (see Numeral Composition 10+n for the former). This aspect is not
to be confused with the use of decimal versus vigesimal bases (see
Decimal Numeral Base; Vigesimal Numeral Base). The positive value is
defined as following the order 20+n, and the negative as following the
reverse order, n+20, alternatively applying an altogether different
organizing principle. 20 is here not to be regarded as necessarily
homophonous or even synchronically fully recognizable from the
expression of the numeral ‘20’. Instead, the formula stands for an
underlying syntactic or morphological structure in which the form of the
corresponding lower numeral *n*, and its relative sequential order as
preposed or postposed in the complex expression, has been taken as
diagnostic. Shughni exemplifies the order 20+n in the formation of the
numerals 21-29, as can be seen in ‎(1), displaying the numerals 1-30. As
can be seen, the numerals 11-19 follow the same order, which however is
not necessarily the case in all of the sample languages with a 20+n
order.

in the southern half of the region, most of which are Indo-Aryan.",Lexicon
LX04a,Kinship: Parent Compound,"Terms referring to one’s parents were investigated. In some languages,
this is expressed though a compound involving the lexemes ‘mother’ and
‘father’, either instead of or in addition to a distinct ‘parent(s)’
lexeme. The relative order of those elements is described by another
feature (Kinship: M-F Compound). Kundal Shahi uses this type of
compound, as can be seen in ‎(1). Typically the two roots are
juxtaposed, as in Kundal Shahi, but explicitly conjoining elements
occur, too.

LX05,Kinship: Grandparents by Parent’s Sex,"In the region, there are two types of grandparent terms: a) those that
make a two-way differentiation based on the sex of the referent, and b)
those that make a four-way differentiation based on the sex of the
referent as well as the sex of the anchor’s parent. The latter is the
positive value of this feature. Such four-way differentiation is
exemplified by Pothwari in (1).
