A feature, as the term is used here, is a structural property of a
language. A conscious choice was made to define features binary. That
means that a given language is classified as either displaying a
particular feature (having the value=1) or that the feature is absent
(having the value=0) as far as the present data set is concerned. In
some cases, for instance when conclusive data is missing, it is marked
as indeterminate.

Our features are not meant to reflect all possible language properties.
Instead they have been chosen, a) to represent areally relevant
features, and b) to cover different parts of the language system (hence
distributed across five macro-categories: Clause structure, Grammatical
categories, Lexicon, Phonology and Word order). The choice of features
to include is also constrained by our present, and relatively limited,
data set.

Each feature presentation contains: 1. A table showing the number of
sample languages displaying the feature, the number of languages in
which it is absent, and the number of languages for which the feature
value is indeterminate. 2. A map showing the geographical distribution
of feature values across the region. 3. A short prose description of the
feature as it occurs in the region, accompanied by one or more
illustrative examples drawn from the data set.

Data references are given in the following way: Sample language-Data
component-Language consultant:Item number. The reference HNO-Val-RH:061
should for instance be read as Hindko language data, provided by a
consultant given the identifier RH, related to item number 061 in the
Valency Questionnaire. Most of the data used in the feature descriptions
belong to one of the seven components listed (along with their
abbreviations) in Project design and data collection.

The abbreviations in the interlinear glossing are to a large extent
standard abbreviations according to the Leipzig Glossing Rules.
