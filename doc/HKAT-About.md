Team and collaboration

As the Principal Investigator, Henrik Liljegren was responsible for the
overall project coordination and implementation, but a large number of
people and groups contributed in crucial ways to the project and to this
database. The main part of systematic data annotation, processing and
analysis took place at Stockholm University. Noa Lange was employed as a
research assistant, primarily working with IPA transcription, various
types of data processing and ELAN annotation. Initially as part of a
project internship, and later as a research assistant, Nina Knobloch
fine-tuned data and prepared the output of structural analysis and set
up a first version of a web interface. Robert Forkel prepared the final
structure and output of the present application.

As part of the data collection process (see below for details on the
data set), six collaborative elicitation workshops were arranged under
the auspices of three different institutions based in the Hindu Kush
region. The PI was present and coordinated the elicitation during all of
these sessions.

Forum for Language Initiatives (FLI), Pakistan. FLI is a
non-governmental organization based in Islamabad. It was established in
2003 to promote the many indigenous languages in Pakistan's mountainous
northern region. It functions as a resource centre for the local
communities, offering training and support in the area of mother-tongue
education, language advocacy, literature development and language
documentation. Two collaborative elicitation workshops were held in
Islamabad in October 2015 and August 2016.

Samar, Afghanistan. Samar is a non-governmental organization. It was
established in 2009 and functions as a resource centre for language
communities throughout Afghanistan, offering training and support in the
area of mother-tongue education, literature development and language
documentation. Two collaborative elicitation workshops were held in
Kabul and one in Faizabad in April 2017.

Department of Linguistics, University of Kashmir, India. The department
hosts a handful of linguistic scholars and some 20 Ph.D. students, many
of whom are dedicated to the documentation and description of linguistic
diversity and multilingualism in Jammu & Kashmir, a union territory in
northern-most India. One collaborative elicitation workshop was held in
Srinagar in April/May 2018.

The contributions of those institutions were primarily in providing
logistic support and work space, identifying and recruiting language
consultants, co-facilitating workshop sessions with the PI, and
assisting in e.g. audio or video recording. In some cases, staff members
or students were instrumental in translating elicitation material and in
digitizing materials (translations, transcriptions or glosses) produced
non-digitally by participating language consultants.

In addition to the collaborative workshops, a few individual language
elicitation sessions were arranged in Islamabad (Pakistan) in August
2016, in Gilgit in August 2016 (Pakistan), and in May 2018 in Kargil
(India).

Totally 79 native consultants, representing 59 language varieties (see
Languages for details), participated in the elicitation
workshops/sessions. These individuals offered plenty of linguistic and
sociolinguistic insights in interaction with the PI and with other
participants, and contributed language data in audio and video recording
as well as through writing. To the extent they were able, the
consultants made draft (mainly non-IPA) transcriptions, translated
portions of text into a language of wider communication, and provided
word glosses.

A number of students at the Department of Linguistics, Stockholm
University, have carried out thesis work related to the project under
the supervision of the PI: Andrew Gomes, Nina Knobloch, Richard Kowalik,
Noa Lange, Julia Lautin, Jane Ogawa, Vanessa Quasnik, Hanna (Kjellberg)
Rönnqvist and Jacqueline Venetz. Those theses can be accessed in the
digital archive of DiVA (Digitala Vetenskapliga Arkivet):

Project design and data collection

With minor exceptions, the dataset collected in each language consisted
of seven components: three word lists, a sentence questionnaire, a
translated parallel text, context-elicited demonstrative expressions,
and a stimulus-based narrative. Apart from the elicitation materials and
instructions in English, translations were made available in three major
lingua francas: Urdu, Dari and Pashto.

| Demonstratives \[Dem\] | Expressions used in reference to objects situated at various distances from the speaker. An elicitation kit for this was designed by the PI, largely inspired and guided by Wilkins (1999) | Audio+video (for a subset, the consultants transcribed their own utterances based on the audio recordings)                          |
| Pear Story \[PS\]      | Natural or semi-natural speech used in retelling the contents of the six-minute "Pear film"; see Chafe (1980) and <http://pearstories.org/>                                                | Audio+video (for most of the varieties, the consultants transcribed their own speech and provided a translation to a lingua franca) |

For the large majority of language varieties (53 of 59), data collection
was carried out in the context of a 4-5 days' workshop, each involving
consultants from five or more languages, in which the following
procedure was followed: the participants were given a basic introduction
to one of the components, e.g. kinship terms, (if applicable) they were
given time to prepare themselves for recording (either individually or
group-wise) by filling in a word list or questionnaire in whatever style
they preferred, they were then invited, each in turn, to a (makeshift)
recording studio to be audio or audio-and-video recorded, and after that
a considerable amount of time was spent in comparing and discussing
particular pieces of data among the participants. All
consultant-produced written material was either saved electronically or
photo-copied, to aid further processing.

Subsequent to data collection, the material was organized, selectively
transcribed (using a broad IPA transcription), analyzed and coded. The
data set allowed for classifying each variety according to 80 binary
structural features, as presented and detailed under Features, with the
cited examples drawn from various components of the set. The elicitation
and processing of the three wordlists generated the data under
Wordlists. Much of the data remains to be fully annotated and is
projected to become available on this site in future installments.

Acknowledgements

This project and the generation of the present dataset would not have
been possible without the generous and positive collaboration of the 79
language consultants that took the time to participate in data
elicitation sessions in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. While it is
unfortunate, we have for safety reasons (particularly in Afghanistan)
decided to let them remain anonymous (apart from people occurring in
photos).

We would like to extend thanks to the teams and individuals from the
three collaborating institutions in the region. A special thanks to
Fakhruddin Akhunzada, Shams Wali Khan, Amir Haider, Naseem Haider and
Muhammad Zaman Sagar of the Forum for Language Initiatives, for
recruiting consultants and arranging two successful workshops in
Islamabad. Thank you so much, Dennis Coyle, Najib Ullah and the rest of
the team at the Samar Kabul office, and Katja Müller, Sani Marzban,
Adina Muhammad and the rest of the team at the Samar Faizabad office,
for recruiting consultants from a number of very remote locations and
for providing excellent services and hospitality in connection with the
three workshops in Afghanistan. Many thanks to Aadil Amin Kak, Irfan ul
Salam and other faculty members at the Department of Linguistics,
University of Kashmir, for recruiting consultants and arranging a
successful workshop in Srinagar.

Thanks also go to Allauddin Torwali for digitizing materials collected
in Pakistan; to Aziz Ali Dad for recruiting consultants and arranging
several individual sessions held in Gilgit; and to Irfan ul Salam
(again) for joining me (Henrik) on that memorable and breathtaking data
collection trip to Ladakh.
